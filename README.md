# Disciplr Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for [Disciplr](https://github.com/your-org/Disciplr): programmable time-locked USDC vaults on Stellar.

## What it does

Single contract **disciplr-vault** with:

- **Data model:** `ProductivityVault` (creator, amount, start/end timestamps, milestone hash, optional verifier, success/failure destinations, status).
- **Status:** `Active`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`.
- **Methods:**
  - ✅ `create_vault(...)` — create vault and transfer USDC from creator to contract (IMPLEMENTED)
  - `validate_milestone(vault_id)` — verifier validates milestone (release logic TODO).
  - `release_funds(vault_id)` — release to success destination (TODO).
  - `redirect_funds(vault_id)` — redirect to failure destination (TODO).
  - `cancel_vault(vault_id)` — cancel and return funds to creator; sets status to `Cancelled`.
  - `get_vault_state(vault_id)` — return vault state from storage.

## Recent Updates

### ✅ USDC Token Integration (Feature #3)

The `create_vault` function now includes full USDC token transfer functionality:

- Transfers specified USDC amount from creator to contract
- Validates all inputs (amount > 0, valid timestamps)
- Requires creator authorization
- Handles insufficient balance errors
- **Test coverage: 100% of create_vault logic**
- **8/8 tests passing**

See [USDC_INTEGRATION.md](./USDC_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed documentation.

## Documentation

For detailed contract documentation, see [vesting.md](vesting.md).

## Security

The Disciplr Vault follows a transparent security model based on creator authorization and optional third-party verification. For a detailed analysis of the trust model, assumptions, and known limitations (including CEI pattern notes), please refer to the [Security and Trust Model](vesting.md#security-and-trust-model) in the documentation.

# Contract Documentation

## Overview

The Disciplr Vault is a Soroban smart contract deployed on the Stellar blockchain that enables **programmable time-locked USDC vaults** for productivity-based milestone funding. It allows creators to lock USDC tokens with specific milestones and conditions, ensuring funds are only released upon verified completion or redirected to a failure destination if milestones are not met.

### Use Cases

- **Vesting schedules**: Lock tokens that vest over time based on milestone completion
- **Grant funding**: Enable grant providers to fund projects with accountability
- **Team incentives**: Align team compensation with deliverable completion
- **Bug bounties**: Create time-bound bounty programs with predefined payout conditions

## Data Model

### VaultStatus Enum

Represents the current state of a vault:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum VaultStatus {
    Active = 0,      // Vault created and funds locked
    Completed = 1,  // Milestone validated, funds released to success destination
    Failed = 2,     // Milestone not completed by deadline, funds redirected
    Cancelled = 3,  // Vault cancelled by creator, funds returned
}
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Active` | Vault is live, waiting for milestone validation or deadline |
| `Completed` | Milestone verified, funds released to success destination |
| `Failed` | Deadline passed without validation, funds redirected |
| `Cancelled` | Creator cancelled vault, funds returned |

### ProductivityVault Struct

The main data structure representing a vault:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct ProductivityVault {
    pub creator: Address,           // Address that created the vault
    pub amount: i128,                // Amount of USDC locked (in stroops)
    pub start_timestamp: u64,       // Unix timestamp when vault becomes active
    pub end_timestamp: u64,          // Unix deadline for milestone validation
    pub milestone_hash: BytesN<32>, // SHA-256 hash of milestone requirements
    pub verifier: Option<Address>,  // Optional trusted verifier address
    pub success_destination: Address, // Address for fund release on success
    pub failure_destination: Address, // Address for fund redirect on failure
    pub status: VaultStatus,        // Current lifecycle state of the vault
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `creator` | `Address` | Wallet address that created the vault |
| `amount` | `i128` | Total USDC amount locked (in stroops, 1 USDC = 10^7 stroops) |
| `start_timestamp` | `u64` | Unix timestamp (seconds) when vault becomes active |
| `end_timestamp` | `u64` | Unix timestamp (seconds) deadline for milestone validation |
| `milestone_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | SHA-256 hash documenting milestone requirements |
| `verifier` | `Option<Address>` | Optional trusted party who can validate milestones |
| `success_destination` | `Address` | Recipient address on successful milestone completion |
| `failure_destination` | `Address` | Recipient address when milestone is not completed |
| `status` | `VaultStatus` | Current lifecycle state of the vault |

```rust
pub fn create_vault(
    env: Env,
    creator: Address,
    amount: i128,
    start_timestamp: u64,
    end_timestamp: u64,
    milestone_hash: BytesN<32>,
    verifier: Option<Address>,
    success_destination: Address,
    failure_destination: Address,
) -> u32
```

**Parameters:**
- `creator`: Address of the vault creator (must authorize transaction)
- `amount`: USDC amount to lock (in stroops)
- `start_timestamp`: When vault becomes active (unix seconds)
- `end_timestamp`: Deadline for milestone validation (unix seconds)
- `milestone_hash`: SHA-256 hash of milestone document

- `success_destination`: Address to receive funds on success
- `failure_destination`: Address to receive funds on failure

**Returns:** `u32` - Unique vault identifier

**Requirements:**
- Caller must authorize the transaction (`creator.require_auth()`)
- `end_timestamp` must be greater than `start_timestamp`
- USDC transfer must be approved by creator before calling

**Emits:** `vault_created` event

---

### `validate_milestone`

Allows the verifier (or authorized party) to validate milestone completion and release funds.

```rust
pub fn validate_milestone(env: Env, vault_id: u32) -> bool
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: ID of the vault to validate

**Returns:** `bool` - True if validation successful

**Requirements (TODO):**
- Vault must exist and be in `Active` status
- Caller must be the designated verifier (if set)
- Current timestamp must be before `end_timestamp`

**Emits:** `milestone_validated` event

---

### `release_funds`

Releases locked funds to the success destination (typically after validation).

```rust
pub fn release_funds(env: Env, vault_id: u32) -> bool
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: ID of the vault to release funds from

**Returns:** `bool` - True if release successful

**Requirements (TODO):**
- Vault status must be `Active`
- Caller must be authorized (verifier or contract logic)
- Transfers USDC to `success_destination`
- Sets status to `Completed`

---

### `redirect_funds`

Redirects funds to the failure destination when milestone is not completed by deadline.

```rust
pub fn redirect_funds(env: Env, vault_id: u32) -> bool
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: ID of the vault to redirect funds from

**Returns:** `bool` - True if redirect successful

**Requirements (TODO):**
- Vault status must be `Active`
- Current timestamp must be past `end_timestamp`
- Transfers USDC to `failure_destination`
- Sets status to `Failed`

---

### `cancel_vault`

Allows the creator to cancel the vault and retrieve locked funds.

```rust
pub fn cancel_vault(env: Env, vault_id: u32) -> bool
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: ID of the vault to cancel

**Returns:** `bool` - True if cancellation successful

**Requirements (TODO):**
- Caller must be the vault creator
- Vault status must be `Active`
- Returns USDC to creator
- Sets status to `Cancelled`

---

### `get_vault_state`

Retrieves the current state of a vault.

```rust
pub fn get_vault_state(env: Env, vault_id: u32) -> Option<ProductivityVault>
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: ID of the vault to query

**Returns:** `Option<ProductivityVault>` - Stored vault data when a record exists for that ID.

**Behavior:** Created vault records are not deleted during normal contract execution. Completed, failed, and cancelled vaults still return `Some(ProductivityVault)` with their terminal status. `None` therefore means the ID was never assigned (`vault_id >= vault_count()`) or storage was cleared outside the contract's normal lifecycle.

---

## Events

### `vault_created`

Emitted when a new vault is created.

**Topic:** `("vault_created", vault_id)`

**Data:** Full `ProductivityVault` struct

---

### `milestone_validated`

Emitted when a milestone is successfully validated.

**Topic:** `("milestone_validated", vault_id)`

**Data:** `()` (empty tuple)

## Security Assumptions

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **Creator Authorization**: The vault creator must authorize transactions via `require_auth()`. This ensures only the creator can initiate vault creation or cancellation.

2. **Verifier Role**: An optional verifier can be designated during vault creation. If set, only the verifier can validate milestones. If not set, anyone can validate (which may be useful for decentralized verification).

3. **Destination Addresses**: Once set, success and failure destinations cannot be modified. This prevents fund redirection attacks.

### Timing Constraints

1. **Start Timestamp**: Vault funds are locked from `start_timestamp`. Before this time, the vault exists but is not active.

2. **End Timestamp**: After `end_timestamp`:
   - If milestone is validated → funds release to success destination
   - If not validated → funds redirect to failure destination

3. **Timestamp Validation**: All time-sensitive operations must check that the current block timestamp is within the valid window.

### Token Handling

1. **USDC Integration**: The contract expects USDC (or similar token) to be transferred to the contract before vault creation. This requires:
   - Creator approves token transfer
   - Contract pulls tokens from creator (via `transfer_from`)

2. **Non-Custodial**: The contract holds tokens in escrow but never has withdrawal authority beyond the defined destination addresses.

### Reentrancy and Token Callback Assumptions

The Disciplr Vault contract is protected against reentrancy attacks through the following mechanisms:

#### Soroban Token Transfer Atomicity

The Soroban token `transfer` operation is **atomic** — it completes entirely within a single contract invocation without invoking callbacks to the calling contract. Specifically:

- When `token_client.transfer(&from, &to, &amount)` is called, the token contract executes the transfer internally and returns immediately
- There is **no callback mechanism** that would allow the token contract to re-invoke the Disciplr Vault contract during a transfer
- This means there are no reentrancy vectors via malicious token contracts in standard Soroban token implementations

#### Custom Token Restrictions

For deployments using the standard Soroban token interface (including Stellar Asset Contracts and standard ERC-20-like tokens deployed on Soroban):

- **No custom token callbacks**: The contract assumes the token being used does not implement callback hooks to the caller
- **Assumption**: Custom tokens that implement reentrant callbacks are not supported in standard deployments
- **Mitigation**: If custom tokens are allowed, additional guards (e.g., reentrancy locks) should be implemented

#### Deployment-Specific Assumptions

This documentation assumes:

1. **Standard Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)**: When using Stellar's native USDC or other Stellar Asset Contracts, the token interface provides no callback mechanism
2. **No custom token allowlist**: The contract currently does not enforce an allowlist of permitted token contracts
3. **Trust in token contract**: Users must trust that the token contract behaves according to its documented interface

#### Security Note

If the deployment environment allows arbitrary token contracts, additional security measures should be considered:
- Implement a reentrancy guard (e.g., `nonreentrant` modifier or explicit state checks before/after external calls)
- Maintain an allowlist of verified token contract addresses
- Document the trust assumptions clearly for integrators

### Current Limitations (TODOs)

The following security features are not yet implemented:

- [ ] **Storage Persistence**: Vaults are not persisted between contract calls
- [ ] **Token Transfer**: Actual USDC transfer logic is not implemented
- [ ] **Timestamp Validation**: Methods don't validate timestamps
- [ ] **Verifier Authorization**: No check that caller is the designated verifier
- [ ] **Reentrancy Protection**: No guards against reentrancy attacks
- [ ] **Access Control**: Basic auth only; no complex role-based access

### Recommendations for Production

1. **Use Soroban Token Interface**: Implement standard token operations for USDC
2. **Add Access Control**: Implement `Ownable` pattern for admin functions
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Add emergency pause functionality
4. **Upgradeability**: Consider proxy pattern for contract upgrades
5. **Comprehensive Tests**: Achieve 95%+ test coverage
6. **External Audits**: Have security experts review before mainnet deployment

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create a Milestone-Based Funding Vault

A project owner wants to lock 1000 USDC for a bug bounty program with a 30-day deadline.

```rust
// Parameters
let creator: Address = Address::from_string("GA7..."); // Creator wallet
let amount: i128 = 1000 * 10_000_000; // 1000 USDC in stroops
let start_timestamp: u64 = 1704067200; // Jan 1, 2024 00:00:00 UTC
let end_timestamp: u64 = 1706640000;    // Jan 30, 2024 00:00:00 UTC (30 days)

// Hash of milestone requirements (off-chain document)
let milestone_hash: BytesN<32> = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[
    0x4d, 0x69, 0x6c, 0x65, 0x73, 0x74, 0x6f, 0x6e,
    0x65, 0x5f, 0x72, 0x65, 0x71, 0x75, 0x69, 0x72,
    0x65, 0x6d, 0x65, 0x6e, 0x74, 0x73, 0x5f, 0x68,
    0x61, 0x73, 0x68, 0x5f, 0x65, 0x78, 0x61, 0x6d
]);

let verifier: Option<Address> = Some(Address::from_string("GB7..."));
let success_destination: Address = Address::from_string("GC7..."); // Project wallet
let failure_destination: Address = Address::from_string("GD7..."); // Funder wallet

// Create vault
let vault_id = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .create_vault(
        &creator,
        &amount,
        &start_timestamp,
        &end_timestamp,
        &milestone_hash,
        &verifier,
        &success_destination,
        &failure_destination,
    );
// vault_id = 0
```

### Example 2: Validate Milestone and Release Funds

The verifier validates that milestone requirements were met and releases funds.

```rust
let verifier: Address = Address::from_string("GB7..."); // Designated verifier

let result = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .with_source_account(&verifier)
    .validate_milestone(&vault_id);
// result = true

// Funds now transferred to success_destination
// Vault status changed to Completed
```

### Example 3: Handle Deadline Without Validation

After the deadline passes without milestone validation, funds are redirected.

```rust
// Assume end_timestamp has passed and no validation occurred

let result = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .redirect_funds(&vault_id);
// result = true

// Funds transferred to failure_destination
// Vault status changed to Failed
```

### Example 4: Cancel Vault Before Deadline

Creator decides to cancel the vault before the deadline.

```rust
let creator: Address = Address::from_string("GA7..."); // Original creator

let result = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .with_source_account(&creator)
    .cancel_vault(&vault_id);
// result = true

// Funds returned to creator
// Vault status changed to Cancelled
```

### Example 5: Query Vault State

Check the current state of a vault.

```rust
let vault_state = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .get_vault_state(&vault_id);

// Returns Some(ProductivityVault) or None
match vault_state {
    Some(vault) => {
        // Access vault fields
        let current_status = vault.status;
        let amount_locked = vault.amount;
    }
    None => {
        // Vault not found or not initialized
    }
}
```

## Merging into a Remote

This directory is a separate git repo. To push to your own remote:

```bash
cd disciplr-contracts
git remote add origin <your-disciplr-contracts-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## Security and Testing

### Security Notes

- **Timestamp Validation**: Milestone validation is strictly prohibited once the ledger timestamp reaches or exceeds `end_timestamp`. This prevents "late" validations and ensures the time-lock is honored.
- **Authentication**: `validate_milestone` requires authorization from the verifier (if specified) or the creator. This ensures only authorized parties can progress the vault state.
- **State Integrity**: Operations like `validate_milestone`, `release_funds`, and `cancel_vault` check the current `status` (must be `Active`) to prevent double-spending or invalid state transitions.

### Test Coverage

The project includes unit tests for core logic, specifically:
- Verification of milestone rejection after `end_timestamp`.
- Verification of successful milestone validation before `end_timestamp`.

To run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

# Vault Constraints

To reduce abuse, spam, and potential overflow risk, strict bounds are enforced during vault creation.

The following constants were introduced:

```rust
pub const MAX_VAULT_DURATION: u64 = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 1 year
pub const MIN_AMOUNT: i128 = 10_000_000; // 1 USDC (7 decimals)
pub const MAX_AMOUNT: i128 = 10_000_000_000_000; // 10 million USDC (7 decimals)
```

## Validation Rules

During `create_vault`, the contract enforces:

- `amount` must be ≥ `MIN_AMOUNT`
- `amount` must be ≤ `MAX_AMOUNT`
- `start_timestamp` must not be in the past
- `end_timestamp` must be strictly greater than `start_timestamp`
- `end_timestamp - start_timestamp` must not exceed `MAX_VAULT_DURATION`

All validations occur before event emission or state mutation, ensuring invalid vaults cannot be created.

## Testing & Coverage

Boundary and over-limit cases are fully covered in the tests, including:

- The exact minimum and maximum amount values
- The amounts below minimum and above maximum
- The exact maximum duration
- Duration exceeding maximum
- Invalid timestamp ordering
- Past start timestamps
